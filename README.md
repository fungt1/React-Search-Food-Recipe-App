# React Search Food Recipe App
PURPOSE: React Project that uses React.js to show a nice represenation of the weather.

This is a simple food recipe search app. Simply type in a specific type of food you want to eat and it will come up with different recipes you can make out of it. The food recipe apis are coming out of Edamam, a food recipe website with apis of different recipes around the web. This was also done with React.js and some other small libraries to enhance this website. NOTE: Future implementations would be adding a cart counter to save the recipes that really stick out to you. And another feature of adding your own recipes. You can find my website here https://foodrecipesearchapp.herokuapp.com/.
